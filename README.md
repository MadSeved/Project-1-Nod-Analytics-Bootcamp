# Projekt-1-Nod-Analytics-Bootcamp
This is the first coding project at the Nod Analytics Bootcamp. In this case a simple video game.

The Video game, named Stockholm to Märsta, takes the player on a post apocalyptic journey through Sweden. On this journey the player is tasked with making certain decisions to improve his or her chances of survival. The game is won once the player successfully makes it to the city of Märsta.
